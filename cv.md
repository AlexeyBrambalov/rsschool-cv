## Personal summary

A hard-working, highly motivated and determined natural team player/leader who is able to develop and drive the business forward.
I am an easy-going person and always maintain excellent working relationships with colleagues and clients. My ambitions and passion for success allowed me to thrive in a competitive retail environment, but I have now decided to make a turn in my career and try myself in Web development.
I have a work visa as a dependant (so nothing for my new employer to worry about) that will allow me to settle permanently in the UK.
